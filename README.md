# 👋 Hi, I'm Pumla Matokazi

I'm a software engineering student currently focused on backend development and data analysis. I build command-line tools, process data programmatically, and write clean, testable code using Python and Java — all within a Linux-first development environment.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Learning

I'm actively developing skills in:

- Backend programming with a strong focus on **problem-solving, algorithms, and data structures**
- Building **CLI-based tools** that interact with files, input/output, and user workflows
- **Data analysis** using Python: working with datasets, extracting insights, and writing logic-driven solutions
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and unit testing for reliability
- Using **Git and GitHub** for version control and collaboration

---

## 💼 Current Focus

- Developing backend logic for real-world problems  
- Creating CLI applications that manage and process structured data  
- Implementing and using **data structures** to solve challenges efficiently  
- Practicing TDD and modular design in Python  
- Building a strong technical foundation in software engineering principles

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, Java  
- **Data Analysis**: Working with structured data (CSV/JSON), basic statistics, data cleaning, logic-based insights  
- **Core CS Concepts**: Algorithms, Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues, etc.)  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Bash, VS Code, Linux CLI  
- **Practices**: Clean Code, TDD, Agile Collaboration  
- **Other**: File I/O, command-line interaction, modular development

## 🎯 Goals

- Master backend development with clean, efficient code  
- Grow confidence in applying algorithms and data structures to real problems  
- Build a portfolio of well-structured CLI tools and backend solutions  
- Collaborate with peers on real-world projects and open-source initiatives

Thanks for stopping by. I’m building software that works from the terminal up — solving real problems, processing real data, and writing code that makes sense.
